## Frequently asked questions

Collaborative place to collect information about the power week

Is there a special terminal command for a pull-request?

Does my Fork need to have the same files as the "original" repository, when I am 
creating a pull request? (in other words can my fork contain additional files which
I don't want to be merged to the original repo?)
