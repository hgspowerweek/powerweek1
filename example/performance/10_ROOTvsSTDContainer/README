This example demonstrates the performance
advantage of modern STL containers compared to the (now deprecated) ROOT implementations.

Note that the comparison is not 100% exact, as ROOT container usually save pointers to objects
whereas with std::vector this is usually not done (but possible).

The performance gain is mainly due to non-virtual dispatch in STL and inlining the comparison operation.
