The example shows the data transfer rate iterating over buffers of different sizes.
The iteration count is chosen as 1/bufferSize such that the totam amount of memory access is always the same.

With increasing buffer size, the throughput first increases, and then decreases stepwise.
The increase at the beginning is because the overhead for loop and function call become less dominant.
The first steep decrease is when the buffer sizes reaches the processor's L1 cache size, such that the data does not longer fit in the L1 cache.
Depending on the architecture, one might see up to two more steps at L2 and L3 cache sizes, but this can also appear as a smooth decrease over time.
