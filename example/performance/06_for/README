Very simple example showing a two dimensional iteration in row-major and column-major fashion.
The two loop do exactly the same thing, but in a different order.

Row-major is by far superior, because the processor will fetch always at least one cache row, and can then use this data for multiple iterations.
In the column-major fashion, the processor must fetch new data every time.
