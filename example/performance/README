This directory contains a set of micro performance examples.
Each examples implements the same code in a slighly different way, yielding different performance.

The examples can be build using "make", and can be run with "make run"

Each directory contains a README.txt, which explains what happens behind the scenes.
We suggest the attendants try to have a look at the code first, then guess which is the fastest variant, run the code, try to explain why there guess is correct / false, and only then look at the explanation!

The code is usually split in multiple parts:
bench.* files contain the actual kernel for the computation.
driver.* files run the benchmark, and provide input and output.
The splitting in the two files is to prevent certain compiler optimizations.
It prevents that the compiler can inline the code from the bench into the driver, and then optimize away.
Therefore, the compilation must not use link time optimization (lto) as shown in the 8th example.

The class example 2 / 2a needs a third intermediate file, to allow inlining from bench.h to intermediate.cpp, but not into driver.cpp.
