LTO (Link Time Optimization) is a technique to optimize a program over multiple compilation units.
I.e. if one has two separate units, compiled separately, the compiler cannot inline a function from one unit into another.
With LTO, this is possible.
LTO increases compilation time and memory demand significantly.
The examples compiles the same program with and without LTO and shows the possible speed gain.
