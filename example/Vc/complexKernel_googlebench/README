This example demonstrates the use of Vc for SIMD programming
on a simple kernel (kernel1). Here google_benchmark is used to benchmark the timing.

The evolution of the kernels is as follows

kernel1: original plain C++ version (a compiler might or might not convert this code into vector instructions)

kernel2: conversion of kernel1 to use Vc types (but this version only works if the number of data elements is divisible by the SIMD register size)

kernel3: fully converted example treating the core loop and the tail part which is not vectorizable. This is using a template algorithm that 
         can be instantiated with SIMD and scalar types.

kernel4: like kernel1 but using the template instantiated with scalar types.
